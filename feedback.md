FEEDBACK

Line 7 Main program usually follows functions

Line 7 What is the meaning of M? Use meaningful variable names.

Line 7 Unclear what I am supposed to enter. Might use something short like (C/F) to be kind to user

Line 14 Functions should take some argument (temperature) and return a number or string. Inputs should not be done in a function
